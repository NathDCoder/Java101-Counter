# Java101-Counter
First Project in a series called Java 101
This is the first part in a series of beginner projects I will be making to help new developers grasp the basics of JS through simple projects. These applied concepts will make it easier for those new to JS to understand them. I give a big Credit to freeCodeAcademy for helping the coding community break down complicated subjects into easy fragments.
